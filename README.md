This dashboard enables businesses to identify sales trends, optimize inventory, and make informed strategic decisions.

## üéØ Problem Statement
The organization requires a centralized and visually appealing dashboard to:
- Monitor sales KPIs at a glance
- Analyze sales distribution across cities and time periods
- Identify top-selling mobile models and preferred payment methods
- Understand customer preferences through ratings and buying behavior
- Provide dynamic filters for in-depth data exploration

## üìù Purpose of Dashboard
- Track overall Sales Performance & KPIs
- Visualize Sales Distribution across Cities & Time Periods
- Identify Top-Selling Mobile Models and Payment Preferences
- Analyze Customer Ratings & Buying Patterns
- Enable Interactive Filtering by Model, Brand, Payment Method, and Date

## üìä Key KPIs & Metrics
1. Total Sales (‚Çπ)
2. Total Quantity Sold (Units)
3. Total Transactions (Count)
4. Average Price per Unit (‚Çπ)
5. Sales by City
6. Sales by Mobile Model (Top 3)
7. Sales by Day Name (Mon-Sun)
8. Units Sold vs Price by Brand
9. Transactions by Payment Method
10. Customer Ratings Distribution (1-5 Stars)

## üìà Visualizations in Dashboard
- **Cards**: Total Sales, Quantity Sold, Transactions, Average Price per Unit
- **Map Chart**: Total Sales by City (Bubble Size by Sales Value)
- **Line Chart**: Total Quantity Sold by Month
- **Column Chart**: Top 3 Mobile Models by Total Sales
- **Pie Chart**: Transactions Distribution by Payment Method
- **Funnel Chart**: Customer Ratings Distribution (1 to 5 Stars)
- **Area Chart**: Total Sales by Day Name
- **Scatter Chart**: Units Sold vs Price per Unit by Brand

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Build the Dashboard

### Step 1: Import Data
- Import Mobile Sales Data into Power BI
- Validate fields: Date, Brand, City, Mobile Model, Units Sold, Total Sales, Price per Unit, Transactions, Ratings, Payment Method

### Step 2: Data Transformation (Power Query)
- Set correct Data Types (Date, Currency, Whole Numbers, Text)
- Extract Month Name & Day Name from Date
- Remove unnecessary columns

### Step 3: UI Customization
- Import Mobile Icon/Logo and place it at the Top-Left Corner
- Set a Light Cyan/Teal Background Theme
- Use Rectangles/Shapes for layout sections:
  - Left Sidebar (Filters/Slicers)
  - Top KPI Cards
  - Main Chart Area

### Step 4: Slicers
- Add a Month Name Slicer (Single Select Mode)
- Add Dropdown Slicers for:
  - Mobile Model
  - Brand
  - Payment Method
  - Day Name
    
### Step 5: Create DAX Measures
- Total Sales = SUMX('Mobile Sales Data', 'Mobile Sales Data'[Units Sold] * 'Mobile Sales Data'[Price Per Unit])
- Total Quantity = SUM('Mobile Sales Data'[Units Sold])
- Total Transactions = COUNTROWS('Mobile Sales Data')
- Average Price = AVERAGE('Mobile Sales Data'[Price Per Unit])

### Step 6: Visualization Implementation
- Cards for KPIs (Total Sales, Quantity, Transactions, Average Price)
- Map Chart for Total Sales by City (Bubble Size = Total Sales, Style = TomTom)
- Line Chart for Quantity Sold by Month (with Data Labels)
- Column Chart for Top 3 Mobile Models (Apply Top N Filter)
- Pie Chart for Transactions by Payment Method (with Percentage Labels)
- Funnel Chart for Customer Ratings Distribution (Sorted Descending)
- Area Chart for Total Sales by Day Name (Sorted Mon-Sun)
- Scatter Chart for Units Sold vs Price per Unit (Size = Total Sales, Legend = Brand, Details = Model)

## üñ•Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Power Query Editor
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
